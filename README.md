## Overview

ForestNet is a novel deep learning framework designed to analyze and quantify collective forest intelligence through multi-variable temporal-spatial analysis. This research explores the hypothesis that forests exhibit emergent intelligent behaviors through their collective responses to environmental changes and stressors.

### Key Features
- Multi-scale temporal-spatial analysis of forest ecosystems
- Integration of multiple environmental variables
- Advanced LSTM-based predictive modeling
- Quantifiable intelligence metrics
- High-resolution data processing (50x50 grid)
- 5-year temporal analysis window

## Dataset Description

SylvaNet utilizes multiple environmental variables collected over a 5-year period:

| Variable | Resolution | Frequency | Source |
|----------|------------|-----------|---------|
| NDVI | 50x50 grid | Daily | MODIS |
| Temperature | 50x50 grid | Daily | MODIS |
| Precipitation | 50x50 grid | Daily | MODIS |
| Soil Moisture | 50x50 grid | Daily | MODIS |
| Solar Radiation | 50x50 grid | Daily | MODIS |

## Model Performance

Intelligence metrics are calculated across three dimensions:

1. **Prediction Accuracy** (0-1)
   - Measures the model's ability to predict forest behavior
   - Typical range: 0.5-0.8

2. **Synchronization Score** (0-1)
   - Quantifies coordinated responses across forest regions
   - Typical range: 0.3-0.6

3. **Adaptive Capacity** (0-1)
   - Evaluates forest learning and adaptation
   - Typical range: 0.4-0.7
